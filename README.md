## Title: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Using Data Analytics
1. Introduction
In the modern business environment, customer retention has become a critical factor for
organizational success. Customer churn refers to the situation where customers stop using a
company’s products or services. With increasing competition, businesses such as banks and
telecom companies are facing challenges in retaining customers. Data analytics helps
organizations analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that lead to customer churn. This
study focuses on understanding customer churn using data analytics techniques to support better
decision-making.
2. Problem Identification and Problem Formulation
Many organizations experience customer loss due to poor service quality, pricing issues, or lack of
engagement. Traditional methods fail to identify customers who are likely to leave at an early stage.
The problem is to analyze customer data and identify key factors responsible for customer churn.
The study formulates the problem as an analytical task to examine historical customer data and
detect churn patterns.
3. Objectives of the Study
- To understand the concept of customer churn
- To analyze customer data using data analytics techniques
- To identify major factors influencing customer churn
- To support managerial decision-making for customer retention
4. Data Collection
The study is based on secondary data collected from publicly available sources such as Kaggle and
online repositories. The dataset includes customer demographic information, service usage details,
and transaction-related variables. Secondary data is suitable for analysis as it is cost-effective and
easily accessible.
5. Research Tool Applied
The study uses Python as the primary research tool for data analysis. Python libraries such as
Pandas and NumPy are used for data handling, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data
visualization. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is applied to identify trends and patterns in customer behaviour
